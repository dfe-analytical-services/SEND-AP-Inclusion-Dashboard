Footnotes:

1. For 2019/20 and 2020/21, while suspensions and permanent exclusions were possible throughout the academic year, pandemic restrictions will have had an impact on the numbers presented and caution should be taken when comparing across years.
2. Total pupil headcounts are only available at spring term each year. Exclusion and suspension rates by ethnicity are therefore calculated based on pupil headcounts as at spring term for the academic year. For Autumn 2021/22, the most recent headcounts available are at spring 2020/21. As a result, total headcounts by ethnicity will not sum to the same total as for other characteristics.
