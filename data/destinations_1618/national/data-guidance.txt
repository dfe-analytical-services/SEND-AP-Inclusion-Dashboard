This release provides information on destinations from:

- state-funded mainstream schools and colleges
- state-funded special schools (including non-maintained special schools)
- independent schools

This information is based on data from the National Pupil Database and the Longitudinal Education Outcomes dataset.

File formats and conventions

The Code of Practice for Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality. Where appropriate we apply disclosure control to protect confidentiality.

The following symbols have been used in this publication:

( 0 ) zero

( c ) small number suppressed to preserve confidentiality or for accountability reasons

( z ) not applicable

(x) not available

( low ) positive % less than 0.5

Small cohorts

At institutional level, where cohorts are less than 6, all data are suppressed. This is to ensure that schools are not held to account for small cohorts of pupils rather than for confidentiality reasons.

This does not apply to levels of data other than institutional level.

Footnotes:

1. Reforms to technical and applied qualifications mean that the makeup of level 3 and level 2 approved qualification groups differ significantly between destination years 2017/18, 2018/19 and 2019/20. Comparisons across years and approved/other qualification groups should therefore be made with particular caution.
2. All other education destinations include school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, independent schools, specialist post-16 institutions, special schools and education combination destinations.
3. State-funded mainstream schools include local authority maintained schools, academies, free schools and city technology colleges.
4. This includes pupils who were captured in the source data and had some participation in the academic year but did not complete the required six months sustained participation.
5. Please note data for independent schools has much lower coverage than state-funded schools. This is likely to be due to difficulties linking their education records to employment data.
6. Local authority maintained includes community, voluntary aided, voluntary controlled and foundation schools.
7. State-funded mainstream colleges includes sixth-form colleges and other further education colleges.
8. State-funded mainstream colleges excludes other government department funded colleges.
9. All schools includes all local authority maintained mainstream schools, sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools, university technical colleges (UTCs), studio schools, special schools and independent schools. Also includes city technology colleges (CTCs). Alternative provision is not included.
10. The student was not found to have any participation in education, apprenticeship or employment nor recorded as receiving out-of-work benefits at any point in the year. Possible reasons for this could be that the pupil was living, working or studying abroad or was attending a Scottish or Welsh college or school. 
11. Other non-selective schools includes all non-selective schools that are not in highly selective areas, including those in areas with some selection.
12. Selective schools admit pupils wholly or mainly with reference to ability. These schools are formally designated as grammar schools. The schools status is based on admission policy in the secondary phase (i.e. age 11).
13. Total state-funded mainstream schools and colleges covers all state-funded mainstream schools, academies, free schools, city technology colleges (CTCs), sixth-forms and other and FE sector colleges. Excludes alternative provision, special schools, other government department funded colleges and independent schools.
14. Total for all schools and colleges includes all mainstream and special schools and colleges.
15. Other are qualifications that are not included elsewhere in the 16-18 attainment performance tables
16. Independent schools: please note data for independent schools has much lower coverage than state-funded schools. This is likely to be due to difficulties linking their education records to employment data.
17. Other FE sector colleges excludes other government department funded colleges.
18. Special schools group include all types of special schools due to the small numbers of schools.
19. Non-selective schools in highly-selective areas includes all non-selective schools in local authorities with a high level of selection (where 25% or more of state-funded secondary places are in state-funded selective schools). These local authorities are Bexley, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Lincolnshire, Medway, Poole, Slough, Southend-on-Sea, Sutton, Torbay, Trafford and Wirral. See technical note for further details.
20. State-funded mainstream schools also includes city technology colleges (CTCs). Figures for this institution type are not shown separately in the table. Excludes pupil referral units (PRUs), alternative provision (AP), hospital schools, maintained and non-maintained special schools, independent schools, independent special schools and independent schools approved to take pupils with special educational needs (SEN).
